# Sample space and probabilities
Definition with a simple example: rolled two 4-sided dice

## Definitions:
- *Sample points*: possible outcome, usually denoted as $\omega$.
		Example: one of dice can be 2 and the other be 3, so $\omega = (2,3)$. 
		**Note: The curvy bracket ( , ) indicate an ordered list!** $(2,3) \neq (3,2)$.
